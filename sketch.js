/* next step: figure out how to add the individual grid/divs in JS. we definitely need a nexted for loop (now up to 16 but eventually 
user input based on the slider). we want them to appear as a grid, instead of one one each line. we could try using inline block. 
we want borders to visually differentiate them but we dont want them to affect the size. how do we make them fill up the size of the
div we have already created (make height height of div/16 and width width of div/16?) but we want them to be squares meaning we 
either change the div to a sqare or pick one side to be the user input and just fill up the rest of the screen with squares according
to that side
